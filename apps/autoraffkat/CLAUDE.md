FCPXML in, FCPXML out. The picture cuts to whoever is talking. Nothing is
rendered.

Code, comments and docstrings are in **Finnish** — they are for the
maintainers. Documentation and everything the user sees is in English and
Finnish. Keep it that way.

## Two layers, don't mix them

`audio/envelope.py` is slow (ffmpeg, seconds) and cached to disk. Write the
cache through an open file handle: `np.save` appends `.npy` to a *path* that
lacks it, so saving to `<key>.npy.tmp` wrote `<key>.npy.tmp.npy` and the
rename then failed silently into `except OSError`. The cache never worked and
nothing said so — test the property, never the speed, because a fixture small
enough to be fast hides a cache that is missing every time. `decide.py`
is fast (numpy, milliseconds) and runs on every adjustment. No file reading may
leak into `decide.py` or into `analysis.build_grid` which it calls — that
breaks the interface response time, which is the single most important
requirement here.

`decide.py` must not loop over individual samples either. Loops walk runs
(`_runs`), of which there are thousands, not samples, of which there are
hundreds of thousands.

## Time is a Fraction

All time read from and written to XML passes through `timeline.py` as a
`Fraction`. Floating point is acceptable only in the analysis layer. The
reason: rounding error accumulates over thousands of frames and leaves gaps on
the timeline.

FCPXML time semantics: a clip's `offset` is in the host's local time base,
whose zero is the host's `start`. A child's absolute position is therefore
`host_absolute + (child_offset - host_start)`. This applies to attached clips
and to sync-clip contents alike, and it is the entire idea behind
`fcpxml/read.py`'s `_walk`.

In a multicam, additionally: the angle's content must be clipped to the
`mc-clip`'s duration (`_walk`'s `bounds`), because an angle spans the whole
multicam and the same multicam can appear on the spine twice.

## A track is not a media file

The unit of roling is `Timeline.tracks`, not `Timeline.media`. In a multicam
the same angle is a different file in each part but one track. Everything that
reads roles, controls or `Segment.angle` speaks in track keys. Without this,
`Roles.wide_key` and `closes` would be lists and every site reading them would
have to handle several keys.

## Roles are inherited between episodes

A new episode with no settings of its own reads the nearest previous
`*.autoraffkat.json` and takes the roles of matching track keys from it. This
is the entire reason a track key is derived from the filename rather than the
angle name or `angleID`: in a series the cameras stay, the angle numbers do
not. Change how the key is derived and inheritance stops working silently.

Loading a plug-in and using one are different rules. pedalboard loads only
on the main thread; it processes from any thread. The error text says
"pass reset=False if calling this plugin from a non-main thread", which
points at processing and hides that the constraint is on loading — a lazy
per-thread load looks reasonable and fails every time. `PluginPool` builds
every instance in its constructor, on whichever thread constructs it, and
hands one to each piece.

The plug-in runs in a child process, and that is not an optimisation.
pedalboard loads a VST3 only on the **main thread**; the server's main thread
is the event loop and cannot be held for minutes. Hosting it in the server
worked by luck until it stopped. `audio/worker.py` reads a job on stdin and
reports progress as line-delimited JSON, so a plug-in that crashes takes
nothing else with it, and the child builds its own envelopes — which is why
ducking can no longer be skipped for lack of them.

Ducking must never fail quietly. It depends on the envelopes, which are
computed in a background thread on load, and pressing the button first left
the grid unbuilt and the masks empty with nothing said. The setting read
-9 dB and the output had none. Processing now waits for the analysis, and
"the setting is on and no microphone matched a mask" is an error, not a
silence — because the symptom is not silence either: independent
normalisation lifts each microphone's bleed of the other speaker, separation
drops from 19.2 dB to 15.2, and the same voice arriving twice a few
milliseconds apart is a comb filter. It is audible only when both tracks
play together, which is to say only after the export.

A de-clicker's threshold is a rate, not a multiplier. Correcting the
reference from a local maximum to a local mean without changing the
multiplier turned a no-op into a distortion generator: measured on real
speech, 2 % of all samples, 550–640 corrections per second, the signal
altered −10 dB relative to itself. It passed every test, because the tests
asked whether a planted click was removed and never how many were found.
Calibrate on how often the artefact really occurs — lip smacks are a few a
minute — and keep the ceiling in `declick`, which raises the threshold until
the findings fit and corrects nothing if they never do.

The plug-in slot is flavour, not a replacement mechanism. There is one
slot, it runs first, and it never stands in for a stage of the chain. The
reason it exists at all is that a speech-restoration model is the one thing
here we have no opinion about and cannot ship; everything after it —
de-essing, the three bounded compressors, the true-peak ceiling, the
normalisation order — was measured, and those numbers are the tool. Letting
a second plug-in in would quietly undo them: someone loads a limiter in
front of ours and the ceiling guarantee stops being true with nothing to say
so. A user who wants their own chain should cut here and master in their
DAW. This is an automation tool, not a worse DAW.

A plug-in window from a plain Python process opens behind everything. The
window is created — measured 536×392 at (0, 37), on screen, thirteenth from
the front — but macOS does not treat the process as a GUI application, so it
never comes forward and the button looks broken. `editor.py` sets
`NSApplicationActivationPolicyRegular` and activates, once before opening and
once after the plug-in has drawn. The title is pedalboard's ("Pedalboard"),
not the plug-in's.

Not everything that changes the result is a parameter. dxRevive publishes
four automatable parameters and the **model selector is not one of them** —
Studio 2 lives in the plug-in's own state, reachable only through its own
interface. `audio/editor.py` opens that interface in a child process
(`show_editor` is main-thread-only *and* blocks until the window closes, so
it cannot run in the server) and saves `raw_state` with the episode. State
is applied before parameters so a saved value cannot override the panel's
slider; a state from another plug-in is opaque and is ignored rather than
raised. It is in `FINGERPRINT_FIELDS`, because a different model is a
different result.

Bleed is linear, so subtract it — do not gate it. The same voice in two
microphones a few milliseconds apart is a comb filter, and it is what a
summed pair sounds like when it sounds metallic. Ducking cannot reach it:
measured on a real episode, the masks fired correctly and closed the
microphone on 64 % of the frames where only the other person spoke, and
*infinite* attenuation still moved the ripple only 6.22 dB → 6.01, because
the gaps fall on the turn-taking boundaries where the bleed is loudest — and
overlapping speech needs both microphones open regardless. `audio/debleed.py`
estimates the leakage path as an FIR filter over the passages where only the
source speaks and subtracts it everywhere: coherence 0.1069 → 0.0098 after
the chain, own speech kept at r = 0.9993. It runs on the raw audio **before**
the plug-in, because a generative plug-in does not preserve the linear
relation between tracks and after it no filter can remove the bleed. And it
measures its own output: a filter that eats the target's own speech is
refused with a reason, because that mistake is only audible after the export.

The level rider comes first, and it cannot work from the signal alone.
A slow level ride before the compressors is the stage every hand-made mix
starts with and ours lacked: it removes the speaker's *own* variation so the
compressor only has to catch what is left, instead of doing the rider's job
badly — fast and level-dependent instead of slow and even.

Two things had to be measured before it worked, and both went the wrong way
first. **Deciding "speech" from the level is worse than not riding at all.**
On a two-microphone recording half of what is loud on a track is the other
person: measured, the level heuristic called 74 % of Nyman's blocks speech
when 53 % were his own, and the two agreed on only 38 %. The rider dutifully
lifted the leakage — the noise floor rose 3.5 dB and the level spread got
*worse*, 2.88 → 3.37 dB. So the mask comes from the grid, the same
raw-measured source ducking uses, and without a mask `ride` returns the audio
untouched rather than guessing.

**And the gain must return to unity outside its own speaker's speech, not
hold.** Holding is what a one-microphone rider does and it is right there;
here the pause *is the other person talking*, so a held boost lands straight
on their leakage. Measured, separation between own speech and leakage fell
19.1 → 14.8 dB. Returning to zero keeps it at 18.7.

What it is worth, measured on ten minutes of real speech: own-speech level
spread 6.72 → 6.44 dB and 6.46 → 5.67 dB, with separation and noise floor
unchanged. Modest, because real speech variation is mostly sentence-scale
emphasis, which the rider deliberately leaves alone. Note also what the same
measurement said about the premise: the compressor does **not** cost
separation either (19.1 → 19.0), so the rider is not the answer to leakage —
de-bleeding still is.

Compute the lags you need, never the whole correlation. `debleed.path`
wants 2048 lags and was slicing them out of a full `2n-1` correlation. A
64-minute microphone is 184 million samples, so that correlation is 368
million floats and its FFT rounds up to the next fast length — gigabytes. At
20 minutes it survived; at 64 it did not, and the "no path" guard turned the
failure into a **reason string instead of an error**. The symptom was that
de-bleeding worked on the short parts of an episode and silently gave up on
the long ones, which reads as "this material is harder" rather than as a bug.
`_lags` accumulates the same sums blockwise: identical to 1e-16 relative,
36 s for the whole file, and both directions now solve at −4.12 and −3.77 dB
with own speech kept at 0.9998.

This is the third instance of the same mistake in this codebase, after
`np.correlate(..., "full")` in the shift measurement and `keyframe_times`
reading every packet to pick 24 frames. When a computation ends in a slice,
check what it computed to get there.

The block's tail must be **zero-padded, not shortened**. When the signal runs
out, a shortened window makes `correlate(..., "valid")` return a single
value, so only lag zero is filled and the "filter" is one number rather than
a path. That hits the final block of every run, and it looks like it worked.

Independent per-microphone normalisation lifts bleed. Two microphones
normalised to the same LUFS get different gains — measured +25.6 dB and
+22.5 dB on one episode — and the 3.1 dB difference lands on the quieter
microphone's bleed of the louder speaker, worsening the comb by exactly that
much. A gentle level rider per track with the loudness set on the programme
avoids it; our chain does not, which is part of why de-bleeding is needed.

## Where people sit is measured, not configured

`staging.py` derives the seating order from the same Vision measurements the
reaction layer already caches, so it costs nothing extra and belongs in the
settings loop. The measure is `turn` — the nose relative to the midpoint of
the eyes — and **its sign is the opposite of the obvious guess**: two people
sitting opposite each other look at each other, so the one on the *left*
looks *right* and has a positive `turn`. Measured on a real episode, the
left-hand speaker read +0.46 and the right-hand one −0.28, the same in both
parts. This was settled by extracting frames and looking at them, not by
reasoning about coordinate systems, because the reasoning gives the wrong
answer confidently. Framing (`cx`) does not work for this: on the same
episode both speakers sat in the right half of their own close-up, +0.51 and
+0.60, which describes the camera operator rather than the room.

The pan positions are spread evenly by *order*, never in proportion to the
measured angle: the angle gives the ordering reliably and the distance not at
all, since it depends on how the chairs happen to be turned and on the lens.
Three speakers are therefore left, centre, right. The spread is tiny on
purpose — a few percent, ±6 at the widest — because speech belongs in the
middle and a wide spread turns a two-hander into a radio play. Above five
speakers nothing is panned: the positions would be closer together than the
measurement is accurate, and then centre beats almost-centre.

Panning goes on the **angle**, not on the clip. Final Cut writes
`adjust-panner` in both places, and only one of them is the feature: a panner
on the `mc-clip` moves every angle together, which is turning the desk rather
than panning, and both speakers land in the same spot. The per-angle form
lives inside `<audio-role-source>`, and it was settled by having Final Cut
write one — the DTD permits it in both places and predicts neither. Three
literals came out of that file and none were guessable: the mode is the
string `"1 (Stereo Left/Right)"`, volume values carry their unit (`"-27dB"`),
and a `<keyframe time=…>` is in the **host's local time base**, the same base
as the `mc-clip`'s `start`, not timeline time. `adjust-volume` and
`adjust-panner` also come *before* `mc-source` in the DTD's order.

Panning does not need the reaction measurement, and must not wait for it.
The two features ask different questions at different prices: reactions look
for *moments*, so every keyframe is a candidate and the decode is minutes;
seating decides one sign per speaker. Measured, **five random frames got the
sign right 400 times out of 400** — the classes sit at +0.46 and −0.28, so
the median settles immediately. `measure.sample_file` therefore takes 24
frames spread across the file, which is far more than needed on purpose,
because some frames have no face in them and the sample must not shrink to
nothing by chance. `SIDE_MIN_FRAMES` is 5 for the same reason it is not 100:
a hundred would have forced the full decode back.

The trap there is `keyframe_times`, and it is the entire cost. It reads
every packet in the file with ffprobe, which on a 20-minute clip is longer
than the frame extraction it was meant to serve — the first version of the
light scan timed out at five minutes doing nothing else. The sample needs no
timestamps at all: `-ss` finds the nearest keyframe by itself, and a seating
position is not tied to a moment. `measure.duration` reads one header field
instead, and the scan went from over 300 s to **22.9 s serial**, four files
in parallel after that.

Both switches start their own scan. A feature that silently requires another
feature's button to have been pressed is a feature that looks broken, so
turning panning on samples the picture and turning reaction shots on starts
the full measurement. The buttons stay, because a minutes-long run is
something you may want to repeat deliberately.

Panning is on or off, and the amount is not a setting. "How much panning"
is a question the user has no answer to — it is precisely the number this tool
exists to decide, and offering it as a slider is handing the responsibility
back. The width lives in `staging.PAN_WIDTH` where it can be measured and
argued about; a test fails if a pan amount reappears in `Globals` or
`TrackConfig`. This is the same rule as "if you can write down the
measurement that sets a default, the slider does not belong on the first
screen", taken one step further: here it does not belong on any screen.

What the panel shows instead is **where the speakers were placed** — left,
centre, right — and it shows it whether the switch is on or off. Panning that
is the wrong way round sounds perfectly fine until you compare it with the
picture, so the placement has to be checkable without exporting first. Same
rule as the reaction lane being drawn while its switch is off.

Nothing is written when the pan is zero. An empty `adjust-panner` is a
setting like any other as far as Final Cut is concerned, so an unmeasured
episode has to produce byte-for-byte the file it produced before the feature
existed; a test asserts exactly that.

## Sensitivity and gain are not the same thing

Sensitivity is a threshold above the noise floor, so gain does not move it —
the floor moves by the same amount. Gain only affects how microphones compare
against each other during overlapping speech. Change this and the controls
start interfering with each other.

A microphone is always mono out, even from a stereo source. Two channels
break the arithmetic in three places silently: de-bleeding reads only the
first channel, the programme ceiling sums stems of differing channel counts
by broadcasting them, and panning is a mono-source idea to begin with. The
`mono` flag is in the fingerprint, so a stereo source that used to be
processed as stereo counts as stale.

## Audio: analyse raw, export processed

`audio/mix.py` is the third slow layer. Two things are not negotiable:

Never write over the original. The envelope cache is keyed on modification
time, so overwriting would recompute the curve — and the new computation would
land on processed audio. Analysis is always done on the raw file: a compressor
raises the noise floor between words and flattens the difference between
microphones, destroying exactly the two things sensitivity and the overlap rule
depend on.

The sample count must not change. The export references the processed file with
the same times as the original. The check exists in two places and anything
deviating is discarded. A shift is measured separately by cross-correlation,
because length alone cannot detect a plug-in that reports its latency wrongly.
That correlation must stay an FFT: `np.correlate(..., "full")` is O(n²) and
took 132 s on a 20-minute file — longer than the plug-in itself. A test fails
if the order of growth comes back.

The plug-in is 97 % of the run and uses **one** core: dxRevive measures 0.98
cores and 7.25× realtime. The only way to reach the other cores is to run
several instances at once, so `chain.apply_plugin` accepts a pool and cuts the
file into as many pieces. This is not the forbidden chunking above: each piece
is its own full `reset=True` run with a five-second margin that is processed
and thrown away, and the result is written into an array of the original
length, so the sample count cannot move. It is not free either — the pieces do
not see each other's context, so the plug-in's slow adaptation differs slightly
between them. Measured on a real 20-minute file: 168.4 s → 68.3 s, and the
difference from the whole-file result is 25.7 dB below the signal in speech and
−84 dBFS in the quiet parts. Because it is not zero, the piece count is
adjustable (`plugin_workers`, where 1 means one run over the whole file), and
because it changes the result it is in `FINGERPRINT_FIELDS`. The default is a
share of the machine's cores, not a number written into the source: an
eight-core laptop and a twenty-core workstation are different machines.

The ceiling is the **programme's** too, and that was missing for longer
than the loudness half. `chain` guarantees −1.5 dBTP per file, but Final Cut
plays the sum: two stems whose peaks are both pressed to the ceiling exceed
full scale whenever those peaks coincide — in theory +4.5 dB, and measured on
a real episode **+4.51 dBFS with 200 clipping bursts a minute**, median
0.23 ms. That is what the red peaks in Final Cut's waveform are, and it is
audible as intermittent crackle on loud syllables. The fix is not harder
per-stem limiting — then every stem pays six decibels of crest for what some
*other* file happens to do — but a **shared curve**: `mix.program_ceiling`
computes the limiter's gain from the summed stems and multiplies the same
curve into each one, so the sum obeys the ceiling and the balance between
speakers cannot move. Measured: sum +4.51 → −1.51 dBFS, cost 0.50 LU, 7 s for
a 20-minute pair. The pass is idempotent by construction — the curve is
`min(1, ceiling/peak)`, so a sum already at the ceiling gets 1 everywhere —
which is what makes it safe to run on every processing round, including one
where most files were skipped as up to date. It sums files sample by sample,
which is only correct when the stems line up, so `_geometry` makes that a
checked fact rather than an assumption and stems that do not match are left
alone.

The loudness target is the **program's**, not one stem's. Two microphones each
normalised to −14 LUFS sum above it — measured on real material, −12.2 — because
the speakers overlap and the microphones hear each other. `mix.program_trim`
measures the sum of the raw microphones over a bounded window and takes the
difference off every file. The window is anchored to the longest microphone
file rather than the middle of the timeline: in a multicam the parts are
consecutive, so the timeline's midpoint lands inside one part and the other
part's files would measure as silence.

Progress is weighted by file size, and the stage is the resolution: the plug-in
processes a file in one piece and cannot be asked how far along it is. Shares
in `chain.STAGES_*` are measured, not guessed. Processing also logs each file
and stage to the terminal — when it is slow or fails, the question is always
which file and which stage.

When an asset's `src` is redirected, the `uid` must be removed too. Final Cut
identifies media by `uid`, not by path: an asset that keeps the old `uid`
claims to be the old media, and since the raw twin is a copy carrying that
same `uid` *and* a bookmark, Final Cut collapses the pair and keeps the raw.
The export then sounds right and measures −43 LUFS. The twin keeps its `uid`,
because it really is the original media.

When an asset's `src` is redirected, the `<bookmark>` must be removed. It is a
macOS file reference that beats `src`, and leaving it would mean Final Cut
opens the unprocessed file without saying anything.

Redirection leaves no reference to the original, so every processed microphone
angle gets a muted twin angle carrying the raw file (`_raw_twins`). The twin is
a **copy** of the angle taken before the redirect: it inherits the times and
the `<bookmark>` and is therefore in sync to the sample, and the original `src`
never has to be reconstructed. Own subrole, so switching it on gives it its own
fader instead of summing with the processed track.

`srcEnable` beats `active`. Final Cut never writes `srcEnable="audio"` with
`active="0"`: audio on is `audio` + `active="1"`, audio off is `none` (or
`video`) + `active="0"`. The combination we wrote is a contradiction, and
Final Cut settles it in favour of `srcEnable` — the angle plays whatever the
role says, silently, and the raw twin sums under the processed track. The
twin's `mc-source` is `srcEnable="none"`, which still lists the angle in
Audio Configuration, unticked. When something imports but does not behave,
compare against a multicam Final Cut wrote itself; our reader accepts
combinations the application never produces.

A multicam angle's role comes from `<audio-channel-source>`, not from
`audioRole`. Final Cut ignores the attribute there and leaves the angle on
`dialogue.dialogue-1`; the channel source names the component and is honoured.
Both are written, because that is how it was tested. Established by importing
one version of each and reading the inspector — not from the DTD, which
permits both and predicts neither.

A subrole is only real if the angle carries it. The angles are copied from
the source, so their audio keeps Final Cut's default `dialogue.dialogue-1`;
writing a per-speaker subrole into `mc-source` alone points
`audio-role-source` at a role that is not there. That fails silently — valid
DTD, clean import, `active="0"` applied to nothing — and the raw twin plays
summed with the processed track. `_stamp_angle_roles` sets the role on the
angle, using the same construction as `_mc_sources` so the two cannot drift.

The flat export has no angles, so there the twin is a connected clip with
`enabled="0"`. Twins go on the **lowest** lanes, after the microphones and the
room tone: turning processing on must not move the microphone the editor is
looking at on lane −1. Only a processed track gets a twin.

"Up to date" is a fingerprint, not a modification time. A processed file
newer than its source proves nothing: the plug-in, its controls, the target
level and the ducking depth never touch the source. Comparing times alone made
the button skip every file, return before the first log line and leave the
panel unchanged — indistinguishable from a broken button. `mix.is_fresh`
compares `mix.fingerprint` against a stamp in `~/Library/Caches/autoraffkat/mix/`,
and `FINGERPRINT_FIELDS` is written out by hand so a new setting cannot slip in
or out unnoticed; a test fails if it does. An unknown stamp counts as stale.
`adopt` uses the same test as `process`, or the export would use a file that
processing has just decided to redo.

The processing button belongs in the header, next to Export. It is an
**action**, not an audio setting: the panel decides what processing does, the
header decides whether to do it — the same split as between the cut panel and
Export. The stronger reason is the state it carries. The button says how many
files were made with different settings, and that is exactly what you need to
know at the moment you press Export; at the bottom of the audio panel, in the
right-hand rail below the fold, it was invisible precisely when it mattered,
and an export that used raw audio looks successful until somebody listens.
The count goes on the button itself for the same reason — in the header the
panel's explanatory note is no longer beside it.

The button carries the state, because the work is minutes long and invisible.
`mix.freshness` counts how many files match the settings right now — `stat`
calls and stamp reads, cheap enough for the settings round, which is where it
runs so the button goes stale at the same moment the result does. All fresh
means the button says so and asks for confirmation before re-rendering
(`force`); some stale means it invites a run and the note says how many were
made with different settings. Only the button is swapped in place: redrawing
the audio panel would replace a slider mid-drag.

`target_lufs` is the **programme's** level, not a stem's. YouTube normalises
the finished video; `program_target` converts that to a stem target with the
measured trim, so −14 becomes −15.8 per stem and the sum lands near −13.
Applying −14 to a mono speech stem directly leaves about 14 dB of crest and
sounds crushed; the same figure as a programme target leaves 17.5.

Compression comes in small amounts several times. Every stage caps its own
gain reduction, and the first is multiband so a plosive cannot pull the
sibilance down with it — with one ratio and one limit across all bands,
because differing amounts per band move the tone with the programme. The
ceiling is true peak with headroom: limiting sample peaks to −1 dBFS measured
−0.42 dBTP, since the peaks that clip a converter fall between samples.

The program trim goes into the **target**, never into the gain. The chain
normalises to the target as its last act, so a trim added to the gain is
removed again exactly — measured, stems landed on −14.1 instead of −15.8 and
the reading looked correct.

The processed files stay on disk between sessions, but `MixResult` does not.
`mix.adopt` reads what is already there — `stat` only — and it runs on load and
again at export. Without it, exporting without pressing the button referenced
raw audio while the file name still said `audio`, and that difference is not
noticed until someone listens, by which time the cut has been edited in Final
Cut. Never make the export depend on which buttons were pressed this session.

The ceiling is a look-ahead limiter, never a static attenuation. A static cut
scales the whole file by what its single loudest sample demands, and after
normalisation the peaks are +8 to +11 dBFS — measured, that turned −14.00 LUFS
into −25.74. It also makes the balance between speakers depend on whose
loudest transient was loudest, which is to say random. The level is
re-measured after limiting so speakers land on the same number.

Every compressor stage must be shown to engage. The third stage's
threshold was written `leveler_threshold + 4.0` — four decibels *above* the
second — and it runs after the second, which has already pulled everything
under its own threshold. It therefore never fired: measured on three minutes
of real speech, its gain moved 0.00 dB at every target from −14 to −18. The
chain promised three bounded stages and ran two, and the slack landed on the
limiter. A dead stage crashes nothing, logs nothing and sounds like a working
chain, so `test_every_compressor_stage_actually_engages` runs each stage in
sequence and fails on any that leaves the signal untouched. Note what the
test's fixture had to learn: thresholds are absolute and applied after
normalisation, so a signal whose every burst is equally loud sits entirely
below them and the test passes while measuring nothing. The bursts must vary,
because in speech it is the loud passages that clear the threshold.

The crest that reaches the limiter is set by `PARALLEL_MIX`, not by any
threshold. The output is `0.4·dry + 0.6·compressed`, so 40 % of every
untouched transient survives whatever the compressors do: measured, waking the
third stage moved the pre-limiter peak from +7.55 to +7.16 dBFS, and raising
the multiband's gain-reduction ceiling from 5 to 8 dB moved it not at all —
it was never hitting 5. Peak control therefore belongs to the limiter by
construction, which is worth knowing before reaching for a compressor to
solve a peak problem.

Compression is parallel, and the peak attack is longer than a pitch period.
Two milliseconds modulates the waveform of a 110 Hz voice instead of its
level, which is harmonic distortion: measured −30.9 dB THD at 2 ms against
−36.1 dB at 40 ms. De-essing comes before the compressors, because the
restoration plug-in adds several dB above 3 kHz and one sibilant otherwise
drives the gain of a whole sentence.

The channel strip is in `audio/chain.py`, on pedalboard. Two places where the
library doesn't do what its name promises, both measured:

* `plugin.process(..., reset=False)` **shortens** the result by the plug-in's
  latency (4641 samples with dxRevive). Always use `reset=True`, and never
  feed one instance a file in chunks.
* `pedalboard.Limiter` applies makeup gain: it lifted −20 LUFS to −15.8 and
  peaks to zero. It was replaced by `peak_guard`, a static attenuation that
  never raises.

Ducking is an envelope in the export, not a burn into the file. It is a
level decision, and level decisions belong where the editor can still reach
them: baked in, it was the one setting in the whole chain that could not be
changed without a minutes-long run, and "the ducking is 3 dB too deep" meant
reprocessing every microphone. As `<adjust-volume>` keyframes on the angle it
is one drag. `mix.duck_envelopes` produces the same shape `chain.apply_duck`
burnt — fades **inside** the range, asymmetric, interpolated in decibels —
because the result must not depend on which way it was made.

Two consequences follow, and both are load-bearing. The duck settings left
`FINGERPRINT_FIELDS`, so changing the depth no longer makes a single file
stale: export again, do not process. A test asserts they are absent, since a
silent *re-*inclusion would put minutes back onto a free adjustment. And
`program_ceiling` must apply the envelope while it sums, because the stems on
disk are no longer what Final Cut plays — on this episode 8 and 30 minutes of
attenuation are missing from them, and a ceiling computed without it limits a
programme that does not exist.

The keyframes go on the **angle**, like the panning, and for the same reason:
volume on the `mc-clip` would duck both speakers at once, which is the
opposite of ducking. A shot the envelope does not touch gets no
`<adjust-volume>` at all — an empty one is a setting as far as Final Cut is
concerned. A shot the envelope crosses gets a keyframe on its edge carrying
the value there: without it Final Cut interpolates from the clip's start and
the attenuation restarts from zero at every cut, which is audible pumping
that nothing reports.

## Microphone to the angle, room tone to a lane — and why

Microphone audio goes into the export inside the multicam clip (`mc-source`),
so it cannot lose sync no matter how the user edits in Final Cut. Room tone is
a connected clip, because `mc-source` has no level control — and therefore it
**can** drift on a ripple edit. If someone finds a way to make room tone an
angle with a level, that is an improvement.

## The video layer caches measurements, never scores

`video/` is the third slow layer, and its seam is placed where the change is
expected: **the detector.** `video/detect.py` holds a registry of detectors,
each of which looks at one frame and returns numbers, knowing nothing about
the timeline, the speakers or the scoring. Its `name` and `version` go into
the cache key, so swapping detectors invalidates the cache by itself —
without that, a new detector would read the old one's traces and the result
would be valid, accepted and wrong.

What is cached is the **measurements**, not the score. Adjusting the weights
is then free, and the weights are the part expected to be tuned.
`reactions.py` is the fast layer over it: numpy, no file reading, same rule
as `decide.py` because it runs in the settings loop.

Only keyframes are decoded (`-skip_frame nokey`): measured at 70× realtime
against 16× for a full decode, which is one frame a second at a camera's
usual keyframe interval. Use `-fps_mode passthrough`, never `-vsync 0` —
current ffmpeg does not know the latter at all, and without either the
keyframes are stretched back to full rate, so the same picture arrives
dozens of times with the timestamps out of step with the frames. A test
fails if the frame count returns to full rate: nothing crashes when it does,
it just gets 25× slower in silence.

Frames and timestamps are paired by index, so a length mismatch means every
measurement sits at the wrong moment. That is an error, not a warning. A
frame where the detector found nothing stays in the table as zeros with
`found` false — dropping it would shift every index after it.

Only close-ups of speakers who are actually silent at some point get
decoded. Decoding is the whole cost of the feature, so that narrowing
happens *before* the decode, not after.

Vision's `yaw` is a bin, not an angle. Measured across 9995 frames of real
footage it takes exactly five values — multiples of 45° — and `roll` takes
three, while `smile`, `eyes` and `size`, computed from the landmarks here,
take about nine thousand each. So the one component that separated good
reaction frames from bad was effectively binary, and the continuous ones did
not separate at all. `turn` and `tilt` come from the nose relative to the
midpoint of the eyes, divided by the eye span so face size and distance stay
out of it. `yaw` remains: as a bin, "turned away" is what it detects well.

Reaction shots obey the cut that was already made. Placement began as pure
greed — best score first, 25 s apart, knowing nothing about the edit — and
measured on a real episode that put 18 of 121 within 0.2 s of a cut (a
flash, not a shot), 7 on their own speaker's close-up (a jump cut to the
same face), and 18 inside a host shot under 3 s. `reactions.fits` refuses
all three, and the conditions are applied **before** thinning: otherwise an
interval is spent on a candidate that is then rejected, and no acceptable
one can take its place.

The margin around a cut is `min_shot`, not a constant of its own. A second
was enough to keep a reaction from touching a boundary, but not enough for
the *host* shot to exist: measured, a cut from the wide to Wancke and 1.04 s
later a reaction — the close-up had not begun. The host's head and tail are
shots like any other, so they get the programme's own minimum, which is the
same condition `decide._force_wide` uses to decide whether its three-beat
form may split. One second remains the floor, because a flash is a flash at
any setting. Measured on the real episode: 22 of 98 sat under two seconds
from a cut; the rule costs 14 shots and moves the nearest to 2.50 s.

The interval follows `decide._compute_tempo`, the same 1/f measure that
scales `min_shot`. A fixed interval made the reaction layer the most
metronomic thing in the programme — measured, its interval spread was
σ 10 s against everything else's variation; with the placement rules and
tempo it is σ 17 s. Note there are **two** reaction mechanisms: the older
`LONGTAKE_REACTION` cuts to the co-host on the spine during a monologue and
already used the rhythm engine, and this one puts them on their own lane.

The measurement says *when*, the programme decides *what*. A reaction shot
does not have to be the measured face. Left alone the layer repeats itself:
measured on the real episode, 49 of 83 consecutive reaction shots showed the
same face as the one before, and consecutive close-ups are exactly the cut
`LONGTAKE_REACTION_WIDE` softens by going through the wide. `reactions._vary`
sends the second of a repeated pair to the wide instead — 1 of 83 afterwards,
split 31 / 27 / 26 across the three shots. It is a repetition breaker, not an
alternation: the wide spends the measurement that caused the cut, because a
face is small in it. `Reaction.speaker` therefore stays the measured person
(it is the reason, and `fits` needs it) and `Reaction.shot` names the track
actually shown. Nothing is substituted when the host shot is already the wide.

The gate decides which moments qualify; `reaction_spacing` decides how many
are used. Measured: a gate of 0.03 → 0.40 moves the candidates from 461 to
1875, while what reaches the export moves only from 94 to 131, because
thinning takes one moment per interval and qualifying moments always
outnumber intervals. Showing only the exported count made the gate slider
look broken. Both numbers belong on screen, and `reactions.candidates()`
exists separately from `find()` for that reason.

A word boundary does not exist in this data. The reaction shot arrived too
fast, and the obvious fix — snap the cut to a word — has nothing to snap to:
the envelope switches at syllable rate. Measured over 77 minutes, 26 452
on/off transitions, speech runs median 0.22 s and pauses 0.14 s, so every
reaction was already within 0.06 s of a "boundary" and the metric decided
nothing. What is available is a **pause**: `_snap` moves the cut to the
nearest moment where nobody speaks for `PAUSE` (0.3 s), searching `PAUSE_REACH`
(0.5 s) either way. That is a sentence boundary, and the ear hears it as one.

The cut leads the measured frame. Keyframes come one per second, so a
measurement says the listener looked good *somewhere* in that second — cut at
its start and the picture arrives after the reaction began. `reaction_lead`
(0.4 s) moves it earlier, the same reasoning as a J-cut's lead, clamped so it
can never precede the programme's start. And the length is 2.2 s, not 1.6:
below two seconds the shot begins and ends before a viewer has read the face.

The reaction score is a **gate**, not a ranking. The bar for a reaction shot
is not "outstanding" but "not disqualifying" — in a finished edit most of
them are unremarkable and only have to avoid embarrassment. Measured on 381
candidates against 23 hand marks the two classes do not overlap at all —
worst good 0.0721, best bad 0.0943 — so the threshold goes in the gap.
0.080 keeps all twelve marked good, admits none of the eleven marked bad,
and passes 60 % of candidates; the same job on the quantised `yaw` let 95 %
through. It sits on the tight half of the gap because a missed reaction shot
costs nothing and a disqualifying one costs the take. So the threshold
is the control that matters and the ordering among survivors barely does —
which is why `eyes` and `size` default to zero weight. `eyes` was actively
harmful: a hard laugh closes the eyes, and rewarding open eyes buried
exactly the frames that were worth cutting to.

Video files are decoded four at a time, and four is measured, not chosen.
Decoding one stream does not spread across cores, so the parallelism has to
be across files: measured 22× realtime for one, 38× for two, 73× for four —
and then it stops, 72× at six and 71× at eight. The ceiling is neither the
disk nor the CPU: during a decode `dd` pulled 759 MB/s off the same drive
while the decode held its 254 MB/s, and 66 % of the CPU was idle even at
eight. It is the number of hardware h264 decoders, which threads cannot
add to. On the real path the whole job went 990 s → 476 s.

Measuring the video is a button, and it runs in a thread. Decoding is
minutes and most episodes do not want reaction shots, so it must not happen
on load; the disk cache is what makes pressing it affordable a second time.
A thread suffices — the child process elsewhere is pedalboard's requirement
to load a VST3 on the main thread, and Vision has no such constraint. Both
empty cases are reported separately in the export warnings: on with nothing
measured, and measured with nothing passing the gate, are different
situations, and silence is how this project's recurring failure gets missed.

## The rhythm engine, and why you will miss it

`decide.py` is not a threshold machine. It carries an editing model added in
v26.08.22.48, and nothing in the module names says so — a whole session was
spent rebuilding reaction-shot placement from scratch before noticing it was
already there. If you are about to decide *when* something appears on
screen, read this first.

**1/f tempo** (`_compute_tempo`). Turn-taking rate over a rolling 45 s
window, normalised to its own mean and clipped to 0.7–1.4. It scales the
local minimum shot length as `min_shot / sqrt(tempo)`: quick exchanges cut
faster, monologues slower. Two traps are already paid for. The window slides
inward at the edges instead of shrinking, because a zero-padded convolution
read the first and last 22 seconds as the slowest material in the programme
regardless of content. And it is a summed-area table, not a convolution: the
window is 2250 steps and the direct version cost 75 ms on a two-hour
programme — most of the decision layer, which has to stay in milliseconds.

**J-cuts and L-cuts** are `lead` and `hang`. Lead moves the picture *before*
the new speaker starts; hang keeps the previous face while they fall silent.
Hang is refused during overlapping speech, because then the cut is not caused
by anyone stopping.

**Pause snapping.** Long monologues break at real speech pauses or breath
dips, not on a timer.

**Presets are this model's parameters**, not a preference: broadcast 2.5 s
minimum with J/L cuts, mellow 4.5 s, hectic 1.4 s.

**There are two reaction-shot mechanisms, and they do not know about each
other.** `LONGTAKE_REACTION` cuts to the co-host on the spine when one
person has held the floor too long — a timeout, and blind to what the
co-host is doing. The `video/` + `reactions.py` layer measures when the
listener is actually worth looking at and places shots on their own lane.
The measured one is the stronger signal: it knows *that something is
happening*, where the timeout only knows *that time has passed*. They are united: the long-take rule breaks at a measured moment when one
is within `REACTION_REACH` (4 s), and falls back to the timeout when none
is. The measurement reaches `decide.py` as a plain `(speakers, n)` boolean
array from `reactions.marks` — an array, never a file read, and measured at
24.3 ms → 24.2 ms for `decide()` with marks against without. `marks()`
itself costs 24 ms, so it is cached on the settings that feed it; recomputing
it every settings round would have spent a quarter of the response budget on
something that rarely changes.

Four seconds is the reach because a break dragged further starts to feel
like a different part of the turn. The measured moment also beats the breath
point: a breath says you *may* cut here, a measured moment says there is
something to look at.

`LONGTAKE_REACTION_WIDE` is the three-beat form — reaction, wide, back to the
speaker. Returning through the wide is a softer cut than close-up straight to
close-up, and the wide restores the geography. It only splits when both
halves clear `min_shot`; below that it would be two flashes rather than two
shots.

What the preview shows and what the export writes must agree, or the
difference must be stated. The reaction lane is drawn even when the switch
is off — that is the only way to judge the feature before committing to it —
and for one version that meant the panel showed 96 shots while the export
wrote none, correctly and silently. Anything drawn but not exported says so
on its face.

`apply()` reads globals from a name list, and forgetting to extend it is
silent. Every reaction setting was missing from it: the switch showed, the
sliders moved, nothing reached the server, every state refresh reset it, and
the export correctly wrote zero reaction shots. Everything worked except the
thing that was asked for. `test_every_global_the_interface_shows_can_be_set`
walks every `Globals` field and fails on any that cannot round-trip, so the
next field added has to be listed or explicitly excused.

A reaction shot on a lane is a nested `mc-clip`, not an `asset-clip`. The
first attempt referenced the angle's asset directly: valid DTD, clean
import, and **nothing on the timeline at all**. A hand-made comparison in
Final Cut showed the real shape — a nested `mc-clip` with the host's own
`ref`, its angle chosen by `<mc-source angleID=…>`. As a multicam clip it
also stays in sync, which a separate file reference would not. Times are in
the host's local base, so for a synchronous placement `offset` and `start`
are the same number; Final Cut's own file differs only because that clip was
dragged there by hand. Final Cut writes `srcEnable="all"`; ours must be
`video`, or the close-up's camera microphone sums over the processed mics.

Keywords are where Final Cut shows what a clip is. The browser displays a
multicam clip's *media* name — every shot reads "A-osa" — so the `name`
attribute buys nothing there and the index's Tags tab stays empty. The
speaker goes on as a `<keyword>`, and the DTD fixes the order: `mc-source*`,
then nested clips, then keywords. Put the keyword before the lanes and the
import fails validation.

## Speculative picture goes on its own lane

Reaction shots — cutting to the listener while someone else talks — are not
part of the base cut and must not be written into the `mc-clip` as angle
switches. They go on a **positive lane** as connected clips (mics and twins
are all on negative lanes, so positive is free).

The reason is reversibility without recomputation. Removing an angle switch
means exporting again, and by then the previous export is usually already
imported into Final Cut and edited by hand — the work `next_output_path`
exists to protect. A lane makes removal one selection, leaves the multicam
underneath untouched frame for frame, and gives a free A/B by toggling.

Three rules come with it. The clips are **video only**, explicitly and
verified by importing: a connected clip from a close-up carries that
camera's audio, which would sum with the processed microphones — the same
family as the `uid` collapse and `srcEnable` beating `active`. They ship
**enabled**, because a lane that is off by default is never evaluated. And
`project.name_tag` records them like `audio`, so the export is
distinguishable in the browser.

The known cost is drift: connected clips can move on a ripple edit. For room
tone that is a tolerated compromise; for a reaction shot it means landing on
the wrong moment, which is the only thing it is for. A nested `mc-clip` on
the lane may avoid it — but that is a construction Final Cut does not write
itself, so it has to be settled by importing, not by reasoning.

## Final Cut is stricter than our own reader

The export must be validated against Final Cut's own DTD
(`/Applications/Final Cut Pro.app/.../Interchange.framework/.../FCPXMLv1_*.dtd`,
`xmllint --dtdvalid`). Our reader accepts far more than the importer: once
`tcFormat` was written onto `mc-clip`, which the reader accepted but which
killed the entire import. `clip` and `asset-clip` know that attribute,
`mc-clip` does not.

Derived files do not go inside the `.fcpxmld` bundle but beside it, taking the
bundle's name. The bundle belongs to Final Cut.

An export never lands on an existing file. `project.next_output_path` walks
`-cut`, `-cut v2`, `v3` … until it finds a free name, and `pick`'s
`_OUTPUT_RE` recognises the numbered ones as our own so they are not offered
back as a source. The reason is not tidiness: the previous export is usually
already imported into Final Cut and edited by hand, and that work has no other
source to be rebuilt from.

Final Cut shows `<project name>`, never the file name — so the distinguishing
part of the file name has to be in it too (`project.fcp_project_name`), or
every import looks the same in the browser and the numbering that keeps the
files apart buys nothing where it is actually read.

The name also carries the settings (`project.name_tag`): the rhythm preset
always, deviating controls after it, `audio` when the microphones were
processed. `_OUTPUT_RE` therefore accepts a tag between the suffix and the
number — but only words the tool writes itself, so a foreign
`interview-cut down.fcpxml` is still a valid source. The numbering runs within
one tag: a cut made with different controls is a new file, not a new version.

The whole settings set goes into the exported XML as well. The DTD says
`sequence (note?, spine, metadata?)`, so the `<note>` goes before the spine and
the `<metadata>` after it — the order is part of the rule, not a style choice.
The note is translated (it is a user-visible Final Cut field); the `md` keys
are not, they are machine-readable and prefixed `fi.autoraffkat.`.

## User-visible text is translated, code is not

Everything the user reads goes through translation: server messages via
`i18n.py`'s `t()`, browser strings via `static/i18n.js`'s `T()`. A new error
message means a new key in both languages — a hard-coded string shows up in the
wrong language and nobody notices until a user complains.

Code, comments and docstrings stay in Finnish. They are for the maintainers.

The language is a `ContextVar`, not a global: audio processing runs in a
background thread while the interface is asking for state.

## The pair is a row, not a drawing

A close-up and its microphone are one thing, and the interface has to say so
without being read. It is a patch bay: one **slot** per row — video cell on the
left, audio cell on the right, the speaker's name once in the strip between
them. The pair is adjacency, so the cable is a horizontal line in a fixed-width
strip. It is CSS, not geometry: nothing is measured, nothing is redrawn on
hover or resize, and a crossing cable is not possible to express. The whole
`drawCables` / `chipEls` / `getBoundingClientRect` machinery that the two-list
layout needed is gone, and it should not come back.

The top row is for the tracks that belong to nobody: the wide shot and the room
tone. They are shared by the whole episode the way the other rows belong to one
person. Unassigned tracks live in a tray below the bay, not as rows — a track
with no slot has no pair and therefore no row.

**A slot sets the role.** `assign()` is the only place that writes
`config.role` and `config.speaker`, and it derives both from where the card
landed: video into a speaker slot is `close`, audio is `mic`, video into the
shared slot is `wide`, audio into it is `audio.room_track`, and the tray is
`unused`. There is no role menu any more. Add a new role and it needs a place
to sit, not a new option in a list.

**The name is written once.** It lives on the slot, so a pair cannot break by a
typo on the second track — which is what the old per-track text field made easy
and invisible. Renaming a slot writes to every member track.

**Drag and click are one path.** `picked` holds the lifted track key; both
`dragstart` and a click on a card set it, and every drop target reads it.
`dataTransfer` carries the key too, but only as the native affordance — a
browser will not let `dragover` read it, and the keyboard has no `dataTransfer`
at all. `dropTarget()` wires all four events in one place so the mouse and the
keyboard cannot end up disagreeing about what is allowed.

Below 900 px the two columns cannot sit side by side. Then the slot stacks —
name first, then its video and audio cards — which is the same grouping in a
different direction, and the connector is hidden because adjacency already says
it.

## The first screen ranks controls; it does not hide them

The audio panel showed 26 sliders, eight of them for one feature. The rule:
**if you can write down the measurement that sets a default, the slider does
not belong on the first screen.** That separates the numbers we measured from
the few where taste varies — ducking depth, the plug-in's Mix, the platform
target. Nothing is removed: every control is still there, one disclosure
away, and now carries its measurement (`why.<key>` in `i18n.js`) beside the
number.

A row with two actions must not highlight as one. Switching a setting on and
looking inside it are different intentions, and a hover covering the whole
row — checkbox included — promises a single target where there are two. A
checkbox at the far left is read as the label's own checkbox, which makes
clicking the name look like it toggles. Opening is a button holding the name,
value and chevron, and only that highlights; the switch sits after it beside
the chevron. The switch is never inside the button: that would be one click
doing both things, and a control inside a `<button>` is invalid.

A preset's own numbers are its definition, not controls layered on it. The
rhythm preset's four sliders were always visible, and moving one switched the
preset to Custom in passing — the choice changed as a side effect. They now
appear only under Custom, carrying the values the preset had.

A closed row must show that something inside it changed, and name it.
Disclosure that hides a setting the user already moved is worse than no
disclosure — the knob vanishes and cannot be found. Same principle as
`project.name_tag` writing deviating controls into the export filename: the
deviation is visible one level up. `audio_defaults` comes from
`AudioSettings()` over `/api/state`, never a copy in JavaScript, because a
copy drifts silently and then the marker is wrong rather than missing.
Opening a row does not redraw the panel — that would swap a slider out from
under the cursor mid-drag.

## The interface has a smoke test, and it is not optional

`node --check` validates syntax only, so it does not notice an undefined
variable. One got through: `renderAudio` referenced a `busy` variable that had
been removed, which aborted the whole render — "Reload" span forever and the
console showed nothing but a `ReferenceError`.

`tests/ui_smoke.js` loads `i18n.js` and `app.js` into a stub DOM and runs every
render function in both languages, with audio processing on and off and with
processing in progress. The state comes from the server for real
(`_state_json`), so a field renamed at only one end fails here too.

Three things keep it honest, and none of them are decoration:

* `test_smoke_catches_an_undefined_variable` injects a broken reference and
  asserts the harness notices. A smoke test that passes everything protects
  nothing.
* The harness fires every registered event handler. Rendering alone runs about
  half the file; clicks, selects and text fields are the other half, and that
  is where an undefined variable hides. It fires one generation at a time:
  handlers that redraw the track list create a whole new set of elements, and
  firing the detached ones again on the next pass multiplies them until node
  runs out of heap. The next pass renders the same interface anyway.
* Every top-level function is wrapped in a counter, and the run **fails** if
  any was never called. Add a function without covering it and the test says
  so by name. Anything genuinely unreachable goes in `NEVER_CALLED_OK` with a
  reason.

CI (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`) runs the suite on macOS with ffmpeg and
Node, and fails if the interface smoke test skipped — a silent skip would
leave exactly this class of bug unguarded.

Note when writing the harness: `let state` in `app.js` is a lexical binding,
not a property of the global object, so `context.state = ...` does not reach
it. Assign it from inside the context.

## Static files are versioned

`index.html` is served with `app.js`, `i18n.js` and `style.css` given their
modification time as a query parameter. Without it the browser serves an old
stylesheet with a new script, and the layout breaks in a way nobody connects to
caching. This happened once already.

## Tests

`tests/make_fixture.py` synthesises the material with ffmpeg: sine bursts at
known positions (`SPEECH_A`, `SPEECH_B`). The project fixture starts at second
1 of the source, the sync clip at zero — comparisons must use the
`source_to_timeline` conversion, not raw numbers.

`multicam.fcpxml` is the same material as two parts: the parts' files are
copies, because grouping looks at the filename rather than the content. There a
timeline moment equals a file moment, so `source_to_timeline` is the identity —
unlike in the project fixture.

Settings are written beside the XML, so tests that export or save need the
`scratch_xml` fixture rather than the shared `fixture_dir`.
